Eminent is a small lua library that monkey-patches awful to provide you with 
effortless and quick wmii-style dynamic tagging. Unlike shifty, eminent does 
not aim to provide a comprehensive tagging system, but tries to make dynamic 
tagging as simple as possible. In fact, besides importing the eminent library, 
you do not have to change your rc.lua at all, eminent does all the work for you.


Setting Up Eminent

Setting up eminent is as simple as adding require("eminent") to the top of your 
rc.lua, after including awful.
You don't need to change anything else in your rc.lua. If something does go 
wrong (awesome is so versatile one can't possible test every setup), don't 
hesitate to send an email to lucas@glacicle.org with your bug report.


Using Eminent

Use your awesome installation the same way you always did. You'll notice that 
any tags that have no clients on them are automatically hidden. Moving to the 
next tag after the last one will "create" (either re-use an existing but empty 
tag or actually create a new one dynamically) a new tag for you to use.
If you have any bindings set up on your number keys you should be able to use 
those to jump to a specific tag irregardless of what eminent thinks.
Happy tagging !
